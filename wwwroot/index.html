    <p>
        I believe that my biggest goal for 413 is to learn my place in a development work environment.
        I can tell that one of the skills that I am good at is programming, or at least that is what I have enjoyed so far.
        The biggest thing for most people in the core is being able to choose what to work in. I believe that 413 will give
        me a better idea of which part of the developmental process I would like to be apart of. This is what I hope to accomplish
        from this class.
